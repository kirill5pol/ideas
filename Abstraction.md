Abstraction is an very interesting concept in nature ranging from the molecules, to single cellular life, to human intelligence. 


## Levels of abstraction in nature
- Abstraction in molecules can be though of as taking taking atomic and subatomic particles, combining them in a way that they naturally stay together. While there is inherent randomness in each of the parts (wave function) they act in a way that is very predictable at a higher level.

- In cells we see more of the same. Individual atoms or molecules may not be in the exact places they should be, but the macroscopic (to the cell) behaviour is very consistent and predicable.

- Even evolution works at a higher level of abstraction. Micro-changes through mutations shift the properties of animals; positive traits survive, negative ones die. At this high level, variations in individual cells make almost no difference.


## Abstraction in human thought
- Human intelligence seems to work the same way. Most interestingly is what this leads to. Science, storytelling, math. All of these are abstracting away the world as a model, then looking at possible actions in that model.

	- Mathematics is the most obvious of these, we take something in the real world, look at it, and build some way of mathematically explaining it. Say you have 5 sheep, a wolf eats 3, now you have 2 sheep. At a certain point we begin to build models that are built on those original models (axioms) which may actually have no meaning in the real world at all. (This is actually a pretty good argument for [mathematical fictionalism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophy_of_mathematics#Fictionalism) - [see below](#ADD-LINK-HERE))

	- A hypothesis in science is just another type of abstracted model. In biology or chemistry this makes sense, it's just applied physics... [XKCD](https://www.xkcd.com/435/). But what any type of science entails is taking something we observe, creating a model of the way we _think_ it will act, and testing if we were right. If we're right the model is good, if not then we change the model. (Tinfoil hat: What if there is no physics, or ground truth like string theory, just more and more accurate models?)

	- Storytelling. The most curious type of model. At first glance this seems pretty different from the last two, there aren't any predictions that can be made from a simple story. But the way the abstraction is working is still the same. Take the real world, build some abstract world of what it could be, there are allowable actions based on that model. _Sherlock Holmes: We found the location of the criminal! I'm going to throw a plate at the ground and go take a bath_. Only things that fit inside that abstract model of the world makes sense in the story, whether it be realistic, sci-fi, or comedy. To make a good story it should be logical within the bounds of the model, and that model itself should be logical within the bounds of how _other humans_ see the world. The way see if the story is good is see if it makes sense for other people and _their_ models of the world, or the way they _want_ to see the world.
